I came across this dataset on video streaming subscriptions provided by Maven and decided to conduct an analysis using Power BI. The dashboard was crafted to facilitate easy navigation through the data. To delve deeper, I incorporated slicers enabling sorting by dates and checking payment status.

According to the data, the number of subscriptions showed a consistent upward trend from November 2022, rising from 189 to 275 by February, followed by a decline in April to 223, before rebounding to its peak at 306 in June. However, subscriptions plummeted to a low of 66 in September 2023.

Over the year-long period, paid subscriptions totaled 115k out of a possible 120k, resulting in a loss of 5,187 due to some customers opting out of their subscriptions.

Further analysis reveals that 2,936 customers paid their subscriptions, while 133 did not over the course of the year.

In conclusion, the data can be further refined by specific dates to tailor insights according to individual preferences.
